# Jodahen.nl – HTML Tutorial Website

This project is a **single-page tutorial website** built to practice and demonstrate the core features of **HTML, basic CSS, and simple JavaScript**. It acts as a “playground page” where many different elements are shown on one screen so you can see how they work together.

The goal is not to create a finished website, but a **learning reference** — a place to experiment with HTML tags, styling, media, tables, forms, and simple scripting.

## What This Project Teaches

This page demonstrates almost all beginner HTML concepts in one place:

### Headings & Text
- `h1` to `h6`
- Paragraphs (`p`)
- Pre-formatted text (`pre`)
- Text formatting:
  - `bold`, `italic`, `underline`
  - `sub` / `sup`
  - `small` / `big`
  - `mark`, `del`, `tt`

---

### Styling

Three types of CSS are used:

1. **Inline CSS**  
   Styling directly inside tags using `style=""`.

2. **Internal CSS**  
   Styles written inside a `<style>` block in the `<head>`.

3. **External CSS**  
   Styling loaded from `style.css`.

This shows how each method works and how they combine.

---

### Links & Media

- External links that open in a new tab.
- Images:
  - Regular embedded images.
  - Images that also work as clickable links.
- Audio playback using `<audio>`.
- Video playback using `<video>`.

---

### Layout Practice

The page uses modern semantic layout tags:

- `<header>` – Navigation and title area.
- `<main>` – Main content section.
- `<footer>` – Credits and contact info.

---

### Lists

Examples of all list types:

- Unordered lists (`ul`)
- Nested lists
- Ordered lists (`ol`)
- Description lists (`dl`)

---

### Tables

A basic table demonstrates:

- Table rows (`tr`)
- Headers (`th`)
- Table cells (`td`)
- Alignment and color styling

---

### Forms

Almost every common form input is shown:

- Text input (username)
- Password
- Email
- Phone numbers with pattern validation
- Date picker
- Number input
- Radio buttons
- Dropdown menu (`select`)
- Checkbox
- Text area
- File upload
- Reset and submit buttons

Each input includes proper labels and basic restrictions such as required fields or minimum lengths.

---

### JavaScript Interaction

A small JavaScript function shows how to:

- Select HTML elements by ID.
- Change content dynamically when a button is clicked.

Example behavior:

- Clicking the button changes the text of a paragraph from `"Hello"` to `"Goodby"`.

## Running the Website

There is no setup or installation required.

### To run locally:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Purpose of This Project

This website exists mainly as:

- A **learning sandbox** for HTML beginners.
- A reference page for syntax and element usage.
- A practice environment to test CSS and JavaScript.
- A foundation for adding future lessons or mini-projects.
